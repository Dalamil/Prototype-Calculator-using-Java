# Prototype-Calculator-using-Java
This is the repository for what will (hopefully) be my first project that I share and manage on GitHub.

### I have no clue whether it's a good idea or not to make a repository for this project this early, but here I go.
I will try to keep files and information as simple and concise as possible.
